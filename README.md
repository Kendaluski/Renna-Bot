# Renna-Bot
Discord Bot for Administration and Role Management. Also adds a level system based on total messages

This is a Discord bot I programmed for the Final Project of the Vocational Formation I made.
Its programmed full in PHP (yes, I hate myself ðŸ˜†) and has several functionalities:
  -Creates and Deletes voice and text channels
  
  -Creates, Deletes and Assings roles to users
  
  -Has its own help command that explains what does it do
  
  -Counts with a Ping command to check if she's alive
  
  -Creates a filter for every server she's in. Only Administrators can add an remove words
  from the filter and if a normal user writes a message that contains any of the filter words,
  the user will have a timeout of 5 minutes with a warning.
  
  -Also counts with a level system, in which users level up by sending messages. Each time a user
  levels up, Renna ping him with a message saying which level is leveled up and what role has gained,
  because yes, every new level is a new role to you ðŸ˜„
